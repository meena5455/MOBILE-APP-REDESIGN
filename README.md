#PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This mobile-based Spotify home page UI was created in Figma using a vertical iPhone frame (such as iPhone 13 Mini) with a dark background to match Spotifyâ€™s signature aesthetic. The top section includes a greeting ("Good Evening") and a brief message, both styled with clean, modern typography in white and light gray. Below that, filter buttons labeled "All," "Music," and "Podcast" are designed as rounded rectangles using Auto Layout, with the active filter highlighted in Spotify green. The "Recently Played" section features horizontally scrollable cards with album images and titles, while the "Top Picks" section showcases featured mixes in side-by-side tiles with bold graphics and background colors. The "Mood" section presents pill-shaped mood chips like "Chill" and "Feel Good," each filled with distinct colors and arranged in a grid. At the bottom, a floating media bar contains the Spotify logo, track title area, and a search icon, above a fixed bottom navigation bar with icons for Home, Search, Library, and more. Figma features such as Auto Layout, scroll groups, components, and consistent styling were used to maintain a polished and responsive design.
